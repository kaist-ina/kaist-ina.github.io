<h3>Summary</h3>
Audio Description (AD) is a narration designed to en-
hance accessibility for visually impaired individuals by con-
veying the key visual elements of a video. Thus, automat-
ing AD generation for long-form videos, such as movies
and dramas, provides high social value but is a challenging
task. First, AD must reflect the narrative context of the en-
tire movie, including the storyline, names of characters and
places, and the cultural setting. Second, to avoid disrupting
the immersive experience of the movie, AD must not over-
lap with the charactersâ€™ dialogues, requiring the delivery
of numerous visual elements in concise sentences. This pa-
per presents NarrAD, a training-free AD generation frame-
work that satisfies both of the requirements by leveraging
rich narrative context in movie scripts and curating infor-
mation across narration slots. Experiments on the MAD
dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior
works in both captioning and LLM-based metrics. In the
user study with 600 subjects, NarrAD achieves the highest
user experience and movie comprehensio
