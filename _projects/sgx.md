<h3>Summary</h3>
Many network service providers concern about preserving their userâ€™s privacy located in an untrusted third-party (e.g., cloud platform). To overcome the security issue, our several research projects explore new network system designs that achieve enhanced security properties by leveraging trusted execution environment (TEE) technology such as Intel SGX. Especially, we propose new design and implementation of a Tor anonymity network, a network middlebox, and HSM-based key management systems.
