    introduction: "I am a PhD candidate at INA lab, KAIST advised by Dongsu Han. 
     Before than, I received my BS degree in Electrical Engineering in KAIST, South Korea.
     I am interested in developing systems that use AI/ML approaches. Real-world systems have assumptions that are often different from those of AI/ML approaches. My works aims at 1) designing efficient system that uses AI/ML approaches; 2) improving the AI/ML approaches leveraging the assumptions in the system. All my work involves several months of implementation followed by thorough testing in real-world data.
     Recently, I am striving to redesign genomics software using AI/ML approaches. In the past, I worked on various topics in video delivery system and image super-resolution based on neural network.
